# 🚀 **Your resume is now ready for PDF formatting — next step: LinkedIn**

Would you like:

1. A **PDF-formatted version** of this resume (with layout, spacing, and a clean template)?
2. A **shorter 1-page version**
3. A **more senior-looking version**
4. Or keep as-is and move to **LinkedIn profile rewrite**?

You choose the next step.
---

This is **very helpful**, and your clarifications make your profile **even stronger and more accurate**.
Let me update your positioning and resume content with precision — no exaggeration, no skills you don't have, and a clear message:

> **You are a highly capable engineer who can become a team lead with mentorship,
> but you are not trying to present yourself as a product owner or project manager.**

This is EXACTLY the right way to market yourself for Mid→Senior Hybrid roles.

---

# ✅ FIRST: Incorporating Your Corrections

### ✔ PostgreSQL + TypeORM

Not SQLAlchemy.
Understood — your database experience will reflect this.

### ✔ No Prometheus, No Grafana

Removed completely.

### ✔ You tested X8CLI, didn’t write it → But you DID:

* build complementary CLIs
* build automation
* build a FastAPI wrapper around non-REST (`widgetAPI.jsp`)
* implement configuration-based API testing
  This is strong — and we will highlight it correctly.

### ✔ Leadership Aspirations

We will present it as:

> “Able to lead small automation components or mentoring juniors when needed,
> but seeking a hands-on engineering role with opportunities to grow under a senior team.”

This is ideal for a Mid→Senior Hybrid position.

---

# 🧾 Now I will produce:

## **1. PDF-Ready Resume Version (text layout, you can paste into Word/PDF)**

## **2. One-Page Resume Version (compact, clean)**

Both reflect your corrections and preferred positioning.

# 💬 Ready to move to the LinkedIn rewrite?


----

Absolutely — this clarification is **important** and will make your professional identity even stronger and more authentic.

You’re describing a very valuable industry profile:

> **A highly dependable engineer who takes ownership, cares about outcomes, and can lead components or initiatives when needed — but isn’t claiming to be a formal team leader yet.**

This is EXACTLY what many engineering managers prefer over someone who tries to “act senior” without experience.

Let me integrate this into your résumé and future LinkedIn phrasing in a way that is:

* honest
* confident
* appealing to hiring managers
* aligned with Mid→Senior Hybrid roles
* avoids overselling
* shows leadership *potential*
* doesn’t imply you want to run teams immediately

Below are the updated versions of the key resume sections that include this “dependable, solution-focused, accountable engineer with leadership potential.”

---

# ✅ **UPDATED Resume Summary (with your clarification)**

**SUMMARY**
Python-focused **Observability & DevOps Automation Engineer** known for being dependable, detail-oriented, and committed to delivering high-quality, reliable solutions. Strong systems thinker with experience building observability pipelines, performance frameworks, CI/CD automation, and backend tooling. Takes ownership of problems, collaborates closely with distributed teams, and consistently drives projects to completion. Not seeking a formal leadership role today, but fully capable of owning components and growing into team leadership with proper support. Looking for a **remote role** blending Python automation, observability, and DevOps.

---

# ✅ **Updated Soft Skills / Collaboration & Leadership Section**

### **Collaboration, Ownership & Growth Potential**

* Recognized as a dependable engineer who takes responsibility, cares about system quality, and delivers solutions end-to-end.
* Comfortable owning automation/components while working collaboratively across distributed teams.
* Not positioning as a team leader today but **able to lead initiatives when supported**, mentor peers, and grow into a leadership path over time.
* Strong communication skills; able to explain technical trade-offs, present results, and align with team goals.

---

# ✅ Optional Line for Your Summary (more direct, still humble)

If you want something slightly shorter:

> Known as someone who can be counted on, takes ownership, and cares deeply about delivering good engineering work. Comfortable leading components or initiatives with support, while staying focused on strong, hands-on technical contributions.

---

# 🚀 Why this positioning is powerful

Managers love engineers who are:

* trustworthy
* independent
* ownership-driven
* mature
* self-aware
* not trying to oversell themselves
* technically strong
* collaborative
* leadership potential without ego

You’re hitting all of those.

This makes you stand out more than claiming senior leadership.

---

# ⭐ Should I update BOTH resume versions (full + one page) with this language?

If yes, I will produce clean updated versions and then move on to:

### ✔ LinkedIn rewrite

---

## ⭐ **ABOUT — Short Version (recommended)**

I’m a dependable, ownership-driven engineer who specializes in **Python automation, observability pipelines, performance benchmarking, and DevOps workflows**. I enjoy understanding complex systems, building tools that make them reliable, and helping teams debug distributed behavior.

Recently, I built a full **OpenTelemetry → Fluent Bit → ClickHouse** pipeline, a distributed **FastAPI benchmarking platform**, async Python SDKs, and reusable CI/CD automation for API-driven systems. I care deeply about delivering high-quality engineering work and solving real problems—not just writing code.

I’m not seeking a formal leadership role yet, but I’m comfortable owning components, leading automation tracks, and growing under strong mentorship. Open to **remote roles** blending Observability, DevOps, and Python Automation.

---

## ⭐ **ABOUT — Long Version (more personality, more depth)**

I’m an engineer who cares deeply about solving real problems and building automation that makes systems more reliable, observable, and easier to work with. Over the past few years I’ve gravitated toward work that blends **Python automation, observability engineering, DevOps practices, distributed debugging, and API performance testing**.

I enjoy looking at a system end-to-end, understanding how the pieces fit together, and building the tooling that makes everything visible and testable. Recently, I built:

* A full **OpenTelemetry → OTEL Collector → Fluent Bit → ClickHouse** observability pipeline
* A distributed **FastAPI-based benchmarking and load-testing platform**
* Async Python SDKs + CLI tools for log ingestion and API testing
* CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions) for automated benchmark cycles and Arazzo scenario testing
* A FastAPI wrapper around non-REST endpoints to enable config-driven API validation

I’m known as someone teams can count on—dependable, thorough, and committed to delivering good engineering work. I take ownership of what I build. I collaborate well with distributed teams. And while I’m not trying to market myself as a full team leader today, I’m fully capable of owning components or leading automation efforts with the right support and mentorship.

My ideal role is a **remote engineering position** at the intersection of:
**Observability • DevOps Automation • Python Backend/SDK Development • Performance & API Testing**

## **Python Automation / Observability Engineer (Contract)**

**XPLG — Remote (2024–2025)**

**Summary:**
Part of a distributed team building observability pipelines, performance testing frameworks, CI/CD automation, and Python-based internal tools for a large-scale log analytics platform. Known for dependability, ownership, and delivering reliable engineering solutions.

**Key Contributions:**

* Built an **OpenTelemetry → OTEL Collector → Fluent Bit → ClickHouse** pipeline for metrics and traces.
* Instrumented FastAPI services with OTel for detailed request/response telemetry.
* Developed **Benchmaker**, a distributed benchmarking framework (FastAPI backend + async httpx SDK + ClickHouse).
* Implemented multi-user concurrency and load-testing scenarios using asyncio.
* Built reusable **GitHub Actions workflows** for API testing, log ingestion, Arazzo scenarios, and automated benchmarking.
* Created an async **Python SDK + CLI** for automation tasks (log ingestion, vectorized operations, benchmark recording).
* Developed a **FastAPI wrapper** around non-REST endpoints (`widgetAPI.jsp`) for config-driven API testing.
* Automated environments with **Ansible + Docker Compose**.
* Documented pipelines, contributed architecture diagrams, and supported distributed debugging efforts.
