## **EXPERIENCE**

### **DevOps & Python Automation Engineer (Contract)**

**XPLG — Remote | 2024–2025**

Delivered automation systems, CI/CD pipelines, backend tooling, and observability integrations for a large-scale log analytics platform. Recognized for dependability, clarity, and ownership of complex engineering work.

**Key Contributions**

- Designed and implemented reusable **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines** for API testing, log ingestion, benchmark execution, and Arazzo-driven workflows.
- Developed a **FastAPI-based benchmarking platform** and an async Python load-testing client (`httpx` + `asyncio`) to measure system performance at scale.
- Containerized services with **Docker & Compose**, enabling reproducible local and CI environments.
- Integrated **OpenTelemetry SDK + Collector** to capture traces and metadata from FastAPI services.
- Created a **FastAPI wrapper for legacy non-REST endpoints** (`widgetAPI.jsp`), enabling configuration-driven automation and validation.
- Built internal Python tools (CLI + SDK modules) supporting automation tasks, vector operations, and test workflows.
- Automated environment provisioning with **Ansible**, reducing setup drift and onboarding friction.
- Authored architecture diagrams, documentation, benchmark reports, and troubleshooting guidance for distributed behavior.

**Technologies:**
Python, FastAPI, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, httpx, asyncio, Docker/Compose, GitHub Actions, Ansible, OpenTelemetry, Bash, Linux, pytest, Arazzo.
