Perfect — let’s update **both your resume and LinkedIn** to reflect your refined, clearer, stronger positioning:

# 🎯 **DevOps + Python Automation Engineer (with Observability Integration Experience)**

Not a pure observability architect — but an engineer who can **implement**, **extend**, and **integrate** telemetry pipelines as part of DevOps workflows.

This gives you:

* A *broader job market*
* Lower interview overhead
* A more accurate representation of your strengths
* A unique advantage: **DevOps + Observability fluency**
* Strong appeal to modern engineering teams

Below is your *updated resume summary, headline, experience, and LinkedIn About section*, all rewritten to reflect this refined, powerful identity.

## **DevOps & Python Automation Engineer (Contract)**

**XPLG — Remote (2024–2025)**

Part of a distributed team delivering automation systems, CI/CD workflows, backend tools, load-testing frameworks, and observability integrations for a large-scale log analytics platform. Known for dependability, ownership, strong communication, and delivering solid, maintainable code.

### **Key Contributions**

* Built reusable **GitHub Actions pipelines** for API testing, log ingestion, benchmark runs, and Arazzo-driven workflows.
* Developed **benchmaker-lite**, a FastAPI-based performance & automation system including an async Python benchmarking client (`httpx` + `asyncio`).
* Containerized services using **Docker & Docker Compose**, enabling reproducible dev/test environments.
* Implemented observability integrations using **OpenTelemetry SDK** and **OTEL Collector**, including instrumentation of FastAPI endpoints for traces and metrics.
* Created a **FastAPI wrapper around non-REST endpoints** (`widgetAPI.jsp`) enabling config-based API testing and automation.
* Built Python CLI tools and SDK components for automated testing, vector operations, and log-processing workflows.
* Automated environment setup using **Ansible**, improving consistency, onboarding, and repeatability.
* Contributed architecture diagrams, documentation, benchmark reports, and troubleshooting guides for distributed systems.

### **Technologies**

Python, FastAPI, httpx, asyncio, OpenTelemetry (SDK + Collector), Docker/Compose, GitHub Actions (reusable workflows + DAGs), Ansible, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Bash, Linux, Arazzo, pytest.

# ✍️ **UPDATED LINKEDIN — About Section (DevOps-focused)**

Paste this directly into your profile:

---

I’m a **DevOps & Python Automation Engineer** who enjoys building the tools, workflows, and automation that make engineering teams faster, more reliable, and more productive. I’m hands-on, dependable, and focused on delivering practical solutions — not overcomplicated systems.

My recent work includes:

* Building **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions) to automate API testing, log ingestion, benchmark scenarios, and distributed workflows
* Creating Python-based **automation tools, CLIs, and SDKs** to support internal testing and validation
* Designing a lightweight **FastAPI + asyncio benchmarking platform** to measure performance and system behavior
* Implementing **observability integrations** using OpenTelemetry SDK + Collector (instrumentation, trace ingestion)
* Containerizing services with **Docker & Docker Compose** for reproducible environments
* Integrating automation into distributed systems and debugging cross-service behavior

I’m not positioning myself as a full Observability architect, but I’m very comfortable **integrating**, **instrumenting**, and **operationalizing** telemetry as part of DevOps workflows.

Teams describe me as someone they can rely on — thoughtful, independent, and committed to delivering solid engineering work. I’m comfortable leading components with guidance and excited to keep growing.

**Open to remote roles** in DevOps, Python Automation, CI/CD engineering, platform engineering, or backend automation with observability exposure.
